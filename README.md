This repository demonstrates a common bug in React applications involving the use of `setInterval` within the `useEffect` hook. The issue arises from the closure over the state variable `count`.  The `setInterval` callback uses the value of `count` from when the effect was initially rendered, leading to incorrect updates. The solution demonstrates how to properly update the state using the functional update pattern of `setCount`.
